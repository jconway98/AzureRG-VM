- Select the resource group you created earlier, and be sure to match the region as well. 
- Select your preferred image, if you pick a windows image, you will need to verify that you own a valid windows 10/11 license. 
- After selecting your preferred cpu and memory size, create your credentials. Then, review and create the VM.
